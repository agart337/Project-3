                    At Sloka, education is a journey of self-discovery, where curiosity is
                    cultivated, and creativity is celebrated. The school fosters a nurturing environment where students
                    are encouraged to explore, question, and engage deeply with their learning experiences. With a
                    curriculum that integrates academics, arts, and practical skills, Sloka aims to develop well-rounded
                    individuals prepared for the complexities of the modern world. The school's commitment to

                <div div class="text">
                    Sloka's inception in 1997 marked a significant milestone as the first comprehensive Waldorf school
                    in India. The journey began with educators and parents seeking an alternative to conventional
                    education, leading to the establishment of a school that harmonizes global Waldorf principles with
                    Indian cultural values. Early initiatives included summer camps and open houses to introduce the
                    community to Waldorf education.

                <div class="text">
                    Over the years, Sloka has grown from a modest beginning to a vibrant
                    institution, continually evolving its practices while staying true to its foundational philosophy.
                    The school's commitment to innovation and excellence has positioned it as a leader in alternative
                    education in India. Today, Sloka stands as a testament to the enduring relevance of holistic,
                    child-centered education in the Indian context.

                <div div class="text">
                    Sloka's curriculum is designed to align with the developmental stages of children, integrating
                    academic rigor with artistic and practical activities. In the early years, storytelling, music, and
                    play lay the foundation for literacy and numeracy. As students progress, subjects like history,
                    science, and mathematics are introduced through experiential learning, fostering deep understanding.

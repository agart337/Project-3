                <div class="text">
                    Nestled in the heart of Mumbai, The Golden Spiral School stands as a beacon of innovative
                    learning, inspired by the Waldorf Education system. The Golden Spiral operates
                    up to Grade 10 and adheres to the Steiner curriculum until grade 7, after which they gradually
                    integrate the IGCSE curriculum.

                    <div class="section">Our Philosophy</div>
                    At The Golden Spiral, we believe in educating the whole child – head, heart, and hands. Our
                    unique approach, influenced by the principles of Rudolf Steiner, intertwines academic excellence
                    with artistic, practical, and moral development. We view education not just as a means to impart
                    knowledge but as a vital force that helps shape a child's entire being.

                    <div class="section">Curious and Creative Thinkers</div>
                    Our students exhibit a natural curiosity and a boundless
                    imagination. Waldorf education encourages them to explore, question, and innovate, leading to
                    creative problem-solving skills and original thinking.

                    <div class="section"> Emotionally Intelligent</div>
                    Emotional intelligence is a cornerstone of our teaching. Golden Spiral
                    students develop empathy, self-awareness, and resilience, enabling them to navigate life's
                    challenges with grace and understanding.

                    <div class="section"> Socially Responsible</div>
                    With a deep sense of community and environmental stewardship, our students
                    are acutely aware of their role in the world. They grow up to be responsible citizens committed
                    to making a positive impact.

                    <div class="section"> Lifelong Learners</div>
                    The joy of learning is intrinsic to our students. This enduring love for
                    knowledge ensures they remain lifelong learners, always eager to grow and evolve.

                    <div class="section"> Balanced Individuals</div>
                    Our approach fosters a balance between intellectual prowess and practical
                    skills. Golden Spiral students are as comfortable in a laboratory as they are in an art studio,
                    embodying a well-roundedness rare in today’s specialized world.

                    <div class="section"> Confident and Articulate</div>
                    Encouraged to express themselves and their ideas, our students develop
                    confidence and articulacy. They learn to communicate effectively, a skill crucial in every walk
                    of life.

            <div class="accordion">
                <div class="subheading Maharashtra">History</div>
                <div div class="text">
                    We started with a handful of parents deeply convinced that children deserve more than what the
                    current system of education has to offer, allowing them to learn and grow in a holistic manner,
                    not just as students but as fully expressed human beings.
                    <div class="text">
                        Embracing the Waldorf Steiner education method, we created a curriculum and pedagogy that is
                        timeless and universal, while still being contemporary and scientific. We believe that this
                        method of education is the key to unlocking a sustainable and harmonious future for generations
                        to come.
                        <br><br>
                        Our work is validated by the 150 families who are today a part of our growing community: not
                        only by enrolling their children in the school, but training themselves in the Waldorf way and
                        enriching their commitment to this way of learning.

                    <div class="subheading Maharashtra">Curriculum</div>
                    <div div class="text">
                        At The Golden Spiral School, we take pride in offering an educational journey that respects the
                        natural pace of learning and the uniqueness of each child.

                        <div class="section">Play-group</div>
                        Discovering Through Play: In the Play-group stage, children embark on their first steps in
                        learning through play. This stage is all about exploration, sensory experiences, and fostering a
                        love for nature.Through imaginative play, simple crafts, and nature-based activities, we
                        lay the foundation for social skills, motor development, and a deep connection with the natural
                        world.
                        <div class="section">Kindergarten</div>
                        Nurturing Creativity and Imagination: Here, children learn through stories, songs, and artistic
                        activities, cultivating their creative and cognitive abilities. This stage emphasizes the
                        importance of rhythm and routine, with activities that mirror the natural world. Our curriculum
                        integrates practical life skills with artistic expression, preparing them for the more
                        structured learning of primary school.
                        <div class="section">Primary School</div>
                        Building Foundations and Explorations: Our Primary School curriculum is a beautiful blend of
                        academic learning and creative exploration. It is here that children begin to form a deeper
                        understanding of core subjects like mathematics, science, and languages, intertwined with arts,
                        music, and physical education. We emphasize experiential learning, where concepts are not just
                        taught but experienced and felt.
                        <div class="section">Secondary School</div>
                        Broadening Horizons and Deep Dives: As students mature, they are introduced to more complex
                        concepts and are encouraged to question, analyze, and form their own opinions. Our curriculum
                        balances traditional academic subjects with artistic and practical skills, ensuring a
                        well-rounded education. We prepare students for the real world, emphasizing critical thinking,
                        self-expression, and social responsibility. This stage culminates in the IGCSE examinations.

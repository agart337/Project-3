                    Bangalore Steiner School is an independent, co-educational institution rooted in the principles of
                    Rudolf Steiner's Waldorf education. Recognized by the Government of Karnataka, the school operates
                    as a not-for-profit organization. Its curriculum, tailored for the Indian context, emphasizes the
                    harmonious development of the head, heart, and hands, fostering intellectual, emotional, and
                    practical growth.

                    A collaborative community of teachers and parents works together to nurture a
                    sustainable and holistic learning environment. The school's ethos is encapsulated in its guiding
                    principle: "Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings who are able out of their own
                    initiative to impart purpose and direction to their lives."

                <div div class="text">
                    The inception of Bangalore Steiner School was driven by a collective of parents seeking an
                    educational approach that prioritized holistic child development over mere academic achievement.
                    Dissatisfied with conventional schooling methods, they were drawn to the Waldorf philosophy, which
                    resonated with their aspirations for their children's growth.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    This philosophy emphasizes
                    age-appropriate learning experiences, nurturing curiosity, and fostering empathy and self-reliance.
                    The school's foundation reflects a commitment to creating an environment where children's physical,
                    emotional, and intellectual needs are met in harmony. ​

                    The Chennai Waldorf School, also known as Akshar Centre of Education, embraces the philosophy of
                    integral education inspired by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. This approach emphasizes nurturing the
                    physical, emotional, volitional, mental, and spiritual aspects of a child. The school believes in
                    evoking knowledge from within each student, rather than merely imparting it.

                    Teachers act as guides,
                    facilitating an environment where children can explore and discover their innate potentials. The
                    curriculum is designed to stimulate inner activity, encouraging students to engage deeply with their
                    learning experiences. This holistic methodology aims to develop well-rounded individuals who are
                    self-aware and capable of independent thought.

                <div div class="text">
                    Waldorf Education was conceived by Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner in 1919, aiming to address
                    the comprehensive development of children. The first Waldorf School was established in Stuttgart,
                    Germany, in collaboration with Emil Molt, with the vision of cultivating clear-thinking,
                    compassionate, and conscientious individuals. This educational model emphasizes understanding human
                    development and tailoring teaching methods accordingly.

                <div class="text">
                    The Chennai Waldorf School integrates this
                    philosophy, adapting it to the Indian context while maintaining the core principles of Steiner's
                    vision. Over the years, the school has evolved, blending traditional Indian educational values with
                    the Waldorf methodology to create a unique learning environment.

                        <li><b>What is unique about AKSHAR? How is it different from other traditional schools?</b>
                            <br>
                            The aim is to educate the whole child, “head, heart and hands”. The curriculum is as broad
                            as time will allow and balances academic subjects with artistic and practical activities.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>How long has AKSHAR been in existence?</b>
                            <br>
                            AKSHAR was instituted in 2011 and every year the class will be upgraded till Grade 12.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>When do children begin formal learning?</b>
                            <br>
                            Children start formal learning (i.e.) reading, writing and numeracy in grade one at the age
                            of 6. Cognitive skills can be introduced with relative ease if children have first had the
                            opportunity to develop speech, co-ordination and their relationship to themselves, others
                            and the world around them during the early years (KG).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>What role does art play in the curriculum?</b>
                            <br>
                            Art is a keystone of the Waldorf curriculum, with artistic activities woven into the entire
                            curriculum. Art is not a compartmentalized “lesson” presented without any relationship to
                            the rest of the curriculum. It is an element not only of every activity in the curriculum,
                            but even of every moment spent in the school experience.

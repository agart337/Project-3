                    Founded by a group of concerned parents and educators, Abhaya School emerged from a desire to offer
                    an alternative to conventional education systems. Drawing inspiration from the Waldorf curriculum,
                    the founders sought to create a learning environment that places the child's growth at the center.

                    adapting to meet the needs of its students while staying true to its foundational principles. The
                    school's journey reflects a dedication to educational innovation and holistic development. Through
                    community engagement and reflective practices, Abhaya continues to refine its approach to education.

                    Abhaya School's curriculum is grounded in the Waldorf or Steiner educational philosophy, emphasizing
                    age-appropriate, holistic learning. The program integrates arts, sciences, and humanities, fostering
                    creativity and critical thinking. In early childhood, the focus is on imaginative play and artistic
                    expression, laying the foundation for cognitive development.

                    As students progress, the curriculum

                    high school program incorporates the CBSE curriculum, ensuring students are well-prepared for
                    standardized assessments. Throughout all levels, the emphasis remains on nurturing the whole
                    child—intellectually, emotionally, and physically. This approach aims to cultivate independent
                    thinkers who are socially responsible and creatively engaged.​

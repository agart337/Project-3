                <div div class="text">
                    Advaya Shaale was founded in 2015 through the collective efforts of two Waldorf
                    Kindergartens—Promise Centre at Babusapalya and Prakriti at Indiranagar—and an enthusiastic parent
                    community. The school began with a vision to bring Waldorf education to urban children in Bangalore.
                    Starting with a modest setup, it has grown over the years, reflecting a commitment to holistic
                    education. The school's foundation is inspired by the educational philosophy of Dr. Rudolf Steiner,
                    aiming to educate the whole child by reaching their heart, will, and mind.

                    Subjects are taught imaginatively, integrating artistic elements even in

                    aiming to develop well-rounded individuals. The curriculum also emphasizes rhythm and repetition,

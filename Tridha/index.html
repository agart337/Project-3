                    child and the parents though we give preference to those who have attended our Steiner Education
                    Course. We accept admission forms throughout the year. Boys and girls wear the same uniform – a
                    short
                    cotton kurta combined with their choice of trousers. All Tridha students perform on stage;

                    Tridha has chosen Rudolf Steiner's method of teaching where the curriculum is designed on the
                    basis of a deep understanding of the child's nature. By providing the child with relevant life
                    experiences, the innate sense of wonder and fantasy is kept alive and the child gains interest
                    for the surrounding world. This enables the child's ability to think independently and
                    seek its own answers.

                    Although we are inspired by Rudolf Steiner and his admirable ideas of education, we do not
                    associate ourselves with the Anthroposophical Society. This does not mean that we have cut
                    ourselves off from the fellowship of Steiner Schools, we are very much a part of it.
                    <br><br>We continue
                    sharing our experiences with other Steiner Schools, we persist in encouraging student exchanges
                    between schools and we will keep having experienced teachers visiting Tridha, to ensure that we
                    are still very much in tune with the progress of ideas in the global Steiner community.
                    Tridha is a progressive school, where teachers and parents focus on the needs of the students
                    rather than focusing on proving an ideology.

                    Tridha believes that a child's development must be carefully and lovingly guided if he or she
                    must become a truly productive human being. It is clear that emotional stability, intellectual
                    flexibility,
                    sound judgement and genuine independence will be qualities vital for their future.

                    knowledge but also make them inwardly free, secure and creative adults. It shall always be our
                    endeavour to prepare the students to enter adulthood with self - discipline, social awareness,

                    <b>Respecting the basics</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Our curriculum is based on a system that recognizes and meets the need for strong development of
                    the intellect. We provide a
                    full introduction to the classics, history, geography, mathematics, science. The subjects,
                    today's student needs as a foundation to understand the sources of our stage of social
                    development, cultural influences and complex organisation. During their final years at Tridha,
                    our students are exposed to a few more subjects that are not required by the board like drama,
                    history of architecture, of poetry, however, the tools and skills which these subjects provide
                    the students with are unique.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Subjects</b>
                    <br><br>
                    At Tridha, touching is learning. After material is presented, direct tactile experiences are
                    employed to engage students and help them understand each lesson. This unique approach allows us
                    to cultivate curiosity and critical thinking skills each and every day. Drawing, painting,
                    poetry, recitation, drama, singing, and playing a musical instrument all build on academic
                    skills that deepen comprehension. Each year the curriculum offers content appropriate to our
                    students' development.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Music</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Music is integral to the Tridha curriculum. Singing is practiced throughout grades 1 to 8. In
                    first grade the children begin to play the recorder which is continued until the fifth grade. In
                    sixth grade they move on to playing the Alto and the Tenor. Students are encouraged to play the
                    percussions and string instruments.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Fine Arts and Handwork</b>
                    <br><br>
                    The arts permeate curriculum and encourage curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills.
                    Children pain, draw and create geometric forms. Dexterity is developed as the children learn to
                    knit, crochet, and sew, work with beeswax, clay, and woodwork.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Eurythmy</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Eurythmy translates the sounds, phrases and rhythms of speech, or the dynamic elements of music
                    into movement and gesture. The result has been described as visible speech and visible music. In
                    the art of eurythmy, that which you would normally hear, you see in the movements of the
                    eurythmist. Through eurythmy the children learn to listen carefully and to express, through
                    appropriate movement, what they hear.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Dance</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Students experience the quality of the classical and folk dances as they move to the beat of the
                    percussion.

                    quickly master computer technology, and graduates have successful careers in the computer

                    Think education only happens through memorization and testing? Think again.
                    At Tridha, we add music and art to science, math and English to help our students reach a deeper
                    understanding of their relative concepts.

                    Like all Steiner schools, Tridha is a secular co-educational and
                    non-selective. Admission is strictly on a first-come first-served basis after meeting with the
                    child and the parents though we give preference to those who have attended our Steiner Education
                    Course. We accept admission forms throughout the year. Boys and girls wear the same uniform – a
                    short
                    cotton kurta combined with their choice of trousers. All Tridha students perform on stage;
                    practise
                    handwork, dance and music as well as drawing and painting; develop skills at cooking, carpentry
                    and
                    gardening while mastering the curriculum till class 12.

                        Tridha has chosen Rudolf Steiner's method of teaching where the curriculum is designed on the
                        basis of a deep understanding of the child's nature. By providing the child with relevant life
                        experiences, the innate sense of wonder and fantasy is kept alive and the child gains interest
                        for the surrounding world. This enables the child's ability to think independently and
                        seek its own answers.

                        Although we are inspired by Rudolf Steiner and his admirable ideas of education, we do not
                        associate ourselves with the Anthroposophical Society. This does not mean that we have cut
                        ourselves off from the fellowship of Steiner Schools, we are very much a part of it.
                    </div>
                    <div div class="text">
                        We continue sharing our experiences with other Steiner Schools, we persist in encouraging
                        student exchanges
                        between schools and we will keep having experienced teachers visiting Tridha, to ensure that we
                        are still very much in tune with the progress of ideas in the global Steiner community.
                    </div>
                    <div div class="text">
                        Our aim thus, is to provide all our children with a well rounded education which will guide them
                        to find their own path in life. An education that will not only equip them with skills and
                        knowledge but also make them inwardly free, secure and creative adults. It shall always be our
                        endeavour to prepare the students to enter adulthood with self - discipline, social awareness,
                        wonder and reverence for the world.

                    Balance is the key - fostered by small class sizes, enthusiastic teachers who truly endeavour to
                    know each student, a holistic variety of challenging opportunities, and an inspiring natural
                    environment. Everything we do at Tridha works in harmony so children can tap their talents,
                    follow their passions and make a difference in the world.

                    <div class="section">Respecting the basics</div>
                    Our curriculum is based on a system that recognizes and meets the need for strong development of
                    the intellect. We provide a
                    full introduction to the classics, history, geography, mathematics, science. The subjects,
                    today's student needs as a foundation to understand the sources of our stage of social
                    development, cultural influences and complex organisation. During their final years at Tridha,
                    our students are exposed to a few more subjects that are not required by the board like drama,
                    history of architecture, of poetry, however, the tools and skills which these subjects provide
                    the students with are unique.
                    <div class="section">Subjects</div>
                    At Tridha, touching is learning. After material is presented, direct tactile experiences are
                    employed to engage students and help them understand each lesson. This unique approach allows us
                    to cultivate curiosity and critical thinking skills each and every day. Drawing, painting,
                    poetry, recitation, drama, singing, and playing a musical instrument all build on academic
                    skills that deepen comprehension. Each year the curriculum offers content appropriate to our
                    students' development.
                    <div class="section">Music</div>
                    Music is integral to the Tridha curriculum. Singing is practiced throughout grades 1 to 8. In
                    first grade the children begin to play the recorder which is continued until the fifth grade. In
                    sixth grade they move on to playing the Alto and the Tenor. Students are encouraged to play the
                    percussions and string instruments.
                    <div class="section">Fine Arts and Handwork</div>
                    The arts permeate curriculum and encourage curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills.
                    Children pain, draw and create geometric forms. Dexterity is developed as the children learn to
                    knit, crochet, and sew, work with beeswax, clay, and woodwork.
                    <div class="section">Eurythmy</div>
                    Eurythmy translates the sounds, phrases and rhythms of speech, or the dynamic elements of music
                    into movement and gesture. The result has been described as visible speech and visible music. In
                    the art of eurythmy, that which you would normally hear, you see in the movements of the
                    eurythmist. Through eurythmy the children learn to listen carefully and to express, through
                    appropriate movement, what they hear.
                    <div class="section">Dance</div>
                    Students experience the quality of the classical and folk dances as they move to the beat of the
                    percussion.

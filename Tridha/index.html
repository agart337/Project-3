                    Think education only happens through memorization and testing? Think again.
                    At Tridha, we add music and art to science, math and English to help our students reach a deeper
                    understanding of their relative concepts.

                <div class="text">
                    Like all Steiner schools, Tridha is a secular co-educational and
                    non-selective. Admission is strictly on a first-come first-served basis after meeting with the
                    child and the parents though we give preference to those who have attended our Steiner Education
                    Course. We accept admission forms throughout the year. Boys and girls wear the same uniform – a
                    short
                    cotton kurta combined with their choice of trousers. All Tridha students perform on stage;
                    practise
                    handwork, dance and music as well as drawing and painting; develop skills at cooking, carpentry
                    and
                    gardening while mastering the curriculum till class 12.

                        Tridha follows Rudolf Steiner's educational philosophy, designing its curriculum around a deep
                        understanding of each child’s nature and encouraging independent thinking through meaningful
                        life experiences. This approach nurtures a child’s sense of wonder, imagination, and curiosity
                        about the world. While the school is inspired by Steiner's educational ideas, it does not align
                        itself with the Anthroposophical Society.

                    <div div class="text">
                        However, Tridha remains actively connected to the
                        broader Steiner School community. The school engages in sharing knowledge, student exchanges,
                        and hosting experienced visiting teachers to stay updated with global Steiner practices. Tridha
                        aims to offer a holistic education that fosters not just academic skills, but also emotional and
                        creative growth. The ultimate goal is to prepare students to become self-disciplined, socially
                        aware, and inwardly free adults.

                    Balance is the key - fostered by small class sizes, enthusiastic teachers who truly endeavour to
                    know each student, a holistic variety of challenging opportunities. Everything we do at Tridha works
                    in harmony so children can tap their talents,
                    follow their passions and make a difference in the world.

                    <div class="section">Respecting the basics</div>
                    Students are grounded in essential academic subjects like history, science, and mathematics, while
                    also exploring unique, non-mandated disciplines like drama and the history of poetry and
                    architecture, enriching their educational experience.
                    <div class="section">Subjects</div>
                    Learning is experiential, with tactile and artistic methods—like painting, drama, and music—used to
                    build academic understanding and critical thinking, tailored to each developmental stage.
                    <div class="section">Eurythmy</div>
                    Eurythmy translates the sounds, phrases and rhythms of speech, or the dynamic elements of music
                    into movement and gesture. The result has been described as visible speech and visible music. In
                    the art of eurythmy, that which you would normally hear, you see in the movements of the
                    eurythmist. Through eurythmy the children learn to listen carefully and to express, through
                    appropriate movement, what they hear.
                    <div class="section">Music</div>
                    Music is embedded throughout the grades, beginning with singing and the recorder in early years, and
                    expanding to instruments like Alto, Tenor, percussion, and strings as students grow.
                    <div class="section">Fine Arts and Handwork</div>
                    Artistic and manual activities—drawing, knitting, clay work, and woodworking—encourage creativity,
                    precision, and the development of fine motor skills.

                            <br>
                            Late readers are not at a disadvantage; they often develop a deeper, lifelong interest in
                            reading. Reading is introduced when the child is naturally ready, avoiding stress and
                            fostering genuine curiosity.

                        <li><b>Tell me about the Main Lesson?</b>

                            <br>
                            Main Lesson is a core feature of the Steiner curriculum, where students focus on one
                            integrated topic each morning for 3–4 weeks using storytelling, art, music, and movement to
                            deeply engage with the subject. Each lesson is tailored to the child’s developmental stage.

                        <li><b>Why do Tridha recommend the limiting of television, videos, and radio for young
                                children?</b>

                            <br>
                            Limiting media helps protect and stimulate the child's imagination, which is essential to
                            Steiner education. Concerns include not only content but also the physical and developmental
                            impact of screen exposure.

                        <li><b>How can a class teacher teach all the subjects through the years of elementary
                                schooling?</b>

                            <br>
                            The class teacher leads the daily Main Lesson and forms a deep, lasting relationship with
                            students, fostering academic and personal growth. Specialist teachers support in areas like
                            music and languages, but the class teacher guides the overall learning journey.

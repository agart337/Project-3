                    nearly 100 years ago by Austrian philosopher, social reformer, and visionary, Rudolf Steiner. In
                    Waldorf education, the learning process is essentially threefold, engaging head, heart, and
                    hands—or thinking, feeling, and doing.

                    through a curriculum and methodology that integrates academics, arts, and practical skills.

                    adulthood. This development follows a sequence of 3 seven-year phases, as soul, spirit and body
                    grow together. Each child’s development is a unique expression of the archetypal human journey, with
                    characteristic physical, emotional, and intellectual dimensions and growth patterns.</div>

                    The educational program is developed out of this understanding. Core components of the educational

                    concept; working from whole to parts; use of rhythm and repetition; and observation as the

                    Waldorf students cultivate their intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual capacities to
                    be individuals certain of their paths and to be of service to the world.

                    In the early childhood years, our focus is on fostering a sense of wonder and imagination. We
                    introduce children to the world through storytelling, music, and creative play. Our curriculum
                    includes activities that promote fine and gross motor skills, language development, social
                    interaction, and nature exploration.

                    HOW WE TEACH<br>
                    We believe in providing a nurturing and supportive environment where children can freely explore
                    their surroundings. Our teachers serve as guides, offering gentle guidance and encouragement. Daily
                    rhythms and routines help children feel secure and develop a sense of trust in their environment.

                    HOW WE ASSESS<br>
                    Early childhood assessment takes a formative approach. We primarily rely on observation to
                    understand each child's unique progress. Teachers carefully observe and document children's
                    interactions, play, and social development. Parent-teacher conferences provide an opportunity for
                    dialogue and reflection.

                    mathematics, sciences, history, and world languages. Additionally, Waldorf education emphasizes
                    visual, performing and practical arts, and movement. The goal is to foster a deep love for learning
                    and a sense of curiosity in our students. In Grades 6-8 the curriculum expands and deepens. The goal
                    is to continue to deepen a love for learning while also increasing student confidence, skill

                    Hands-on activities, storytelling, and experiential learning are integral parts of the teaching
                    methodology. Students are guided through a comprehensive educational program that cultivates
                    intellectual, emotional, and social development.

                    HOW WE ASSESS<br>
                    Assessment in Grades 1-5 focuses on a comprehensive understanding of each student's progress.
                    Teachers observe and assess utilizing a combination of methods including written work, projects, and
                    oral presentations. Documenting student work helps track growth and development over time. Regular
                    assessments are supplemented with individual conferences and student self-assessment opportunities.
                    <br>
                    In Grades 6-8 students are evaluated based on their individual progress and growth. Teachers use a
                    variety of assessment tools such as observation and project-based assessment to gain an
                    understanding of each student’s strengths and areas for improvement.

                    appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge. The curriculum includes rigorous academic

                    to develop their unique perspectives and passions. Project-based learning and experiential
                    opportunities are key components of our teaching approach.

                    research projects, presentations, and collaborative assignments. Personal interviews and
                    self-reflection play a crucial role in assessing individual growth.

                    Germany, was looking to develop a school for the children of his employees. Molt was seeking a
                    curriculum that would not only meet the children’s intellectual needs but speak also to their
                    spiritual essence and humanity, thus helping them to flourish in the turbulent aftermath of the
                    Great War.</div>

            <div class="panel">
                <div class="text">
                    To develop this pedagogy, Molt turned to Rudolf Steiner. Steiner agreed to take on the
                    task, under the conditions that the school be:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <br>
                        <li>Self-governed</li>
                        <li>Artistically and culturally enriching</li>
                        <li>Comprehensive (that is, not split into separate academic and vocational tracks)</li>
                        <li>Open to all the workers’ children—girls and boys—from every walk of life</li>
                        <br>
                    </ol>
                    Steiner insisted his school’s teachers perceive and respond to the developmental needs of the
                    children. The intended outcome would be young people who were independent thinkers and
                    problem-solvers, capable of creatively meeting the challenges of their time. This inclusive and
                    forward-thinking spirit of idealism, commitment, and engagement with the world continues to be a
                    hallmark of Waldorf education in our time.

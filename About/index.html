                Waldorf education, also known as Steiner education, is holistic, intended to develop pupils'
                intellectual,
                artistic,
                and
                practical skills, with a focus on imagination and creativity. The learning process is essentially
                threefold, engaging head, heart, and hands—or thinking,
                feeling, and doing. This is the basis out of which Waldorf teachers work to nurture and engage each
                child
                through a
                curriculum and methodology that integrates academics, arts, and practical skills.

                The Foundations of Waldorf Education
                Waldorf education begins with the premise that childhood is made up of three distinct stages of roughly
                seven years
                each—birth to age seven (early childhood), seven to 14 (middle childhood), and 14 to 21 (adolescence).
                Each
                stage
                shapes the way children feel about and approach the world—intellectually, emotionally, physically, and
                spiritually—which, in turn, shapes the way they learn. Waldorf educators believe that curricula and
                teaching
                methods
                should be appropriately tailored to these developmental stages, each evolving as childhood unfolds.

                Early Childhood – Develop the limbs through doing
                Young children from birth to age seven live primarily through their senses and learn best through
                imitation.
                Striving to be figures worthy of imitation, Waldorf early childhood educators nurture each child’s
                flowering,
                providing gentle, yet sensory rich environments and play-based activities that encourage the young child
                to
                investigate the natural world, explore social relationships, and expand imaginative capacities. These
                activities lay
                crucial foundations for intellectual, emotional, and physical development.

                Middle Childhood – Develop the heart through imagination
                Between the ages of seven and 14, children learn best through lessons that touch their feelings and
                enliven
                their
                creative forces. The Waldorf lower school curriculum is alive with fairy tales and fables, mythological
                sagas, and
                stirring biographies of historical figures. Waldorf elementary (or “class”) teachers integrate
                storytelling,
                drama,
                rhythmic movement, visual arts, and music into their daily work, weaving a tapestry of experience that
                brings each
                subject to life in the child’s thinking, feeling, and willing. Entrusted with the essential task of
                accompanying
                their students on a several-year journey, Waldorf grades 1-8 teachers have a role analogous to that of
                effective
                parent, guiding the children’s formal academic learning while awakening their moral development and
                increasing their
                awareness of their place in the world.

                Adolescence – Develop the mind through discernment of the world
                Ages 14 to 21 marks the development of the independent intellect and, along with it, the ability to
                examine
                the
                world abstractly and exercise discernment, judgment, and critical thinking. Students in Waldorf high
                schools
                are
                given increasing autonomy over their education under the mentorship of teachers who are specialists in
                their
                fields.

                The Benefits of Waldorf Education
                Children enjoy an unhurried childhood.
                Visit a Waldorf school and watch the students at play. You’ll see children who delight in being allowed
                to
                live in
                the moment, who are free to explore nature and to go where their wide-eyed sense of wonder and
                imagination
                takes
                them. In our frenetic world, where pushing children to “hurry up or fall behind” has become the norm,
                Waldorf
                education takes the point of view that childhood is something to be savored. By being free to develop
                according to
                their own natural rhythms, Waldorf-educated children enjoy full and rich childhoods, gaining the
                experiences
                they
                need to become healthy, self-actualized individuals.

                Learning is hands-on and age-appropriate.
                You won’t find young children hovering around a computer in a Waldorf school classroom or missing a walk
                in
                the
                woods or a trip to the farm in order to sit and cram for a standardized test. In Waldorf education,
                learning
                is an
                experiential activity. It’s not a matter of doing without certain experiences, it’s a matter of
                introducing
                children
                to each experience at the right time in their development. When it’s time to teach the merits, uses, and
                hows of
                technology, Waldorf school teachers do so. And the knowledge, self-awareness, and problem-solving skills
                children
                develop through years of hands-on inquiry is of far greater value to them as learners and as human
                beings
                than
                anything they could have picked up by sitting at a screen.

                In-depth study enriches learning experiences.
                The advantages of block learning have long been recognized in Waldorf education. In their daily morning
                (or
                “main”)
                lesson, Waldorf students from first through twelfth grade spend up to two hours concentrating on one
                subject
                which
                rotates every 3-4 weeks among the academic disciplines. Students have the chance to study each subject
                thoroughly
                and from a number of vantage points, which contributes to their enjoyment—and their understanding—of the
                subject
                matter.

                Students learn how to take an active role in their own education.
                From discovering the alphabet in the first grade to discovering anatomy, algebra, and U.S. history in
                the
                eighth
                grade, and all the way up through their high school studies, Waldorf students take part in the learning
                process by
                creating their own textbooks—beautifully-drawn journals containing stories, essays, poems, maps,
                illustrations, lab
                descriptions, and math equations. Rather than relying on pre-digested material presented to them in
                conventional
                textbooks, the act of creating their “main lesson” books allows children to absorb the lessons their
                teachers bring
                them and to make learning their own.

                Waldorf schools produce well-rounded individuals.
                Waldorf educators strive to bring out what lives in each student, but are careful not to over-emphasize
                one
                trait or
                skill over another. All students study math and science and learn foreign languages; they all play an
                instrument and
                sing in the chorus; they all learn handwork and take movement classes and perform in the class play. The
                goal in
                Waldorf education is to expose children to a wide range of experiences and to develop within them many
                interests and
                capabilities. This, in turn, leads to well-balanced young people with high levels of confidence in their
                ability to
                apply skills developed in one area to another, and the knowledge that they can master anything.

                Waldorf-educated individuals have a lifelong passion for learning.
                At a Waldorf school, education is not measured by competition and test scores, but is viewed as a
                life-long
                journey.
                And an educational approach that appropriately responds to a child’s natural interest in the world
                cannot
                help but
                result in an intrinsic desire to find out more.

                Waldorf schools are sometimes erroneously seen as “art schools” because of the depth of the fine,
                practical,
                and
                performing arts curriculum you’ll find here, woven in an interdisciplinary fashion among all the
                subjects.
                Interestingly, however, it’s actually the sciences that become a career choice for many Waldorf school
                alumni—an
                interest developed through years of exploration, invention, and discovery.

                The Central Role of a Waldorf Teacher
                While Waldorf education places children at the heart of its pedagogy, Waldorf schools depend on the
                teacher
                as a
                fulcrum for the educational process. The individual who chooses to teach in a Waldorf school brings his
                or
                her full
                self to the development of others, providing mentoring, development, and affection that sustain the
                students
                for
                life.

                “If someone wants to make a difference in the world, I can’t think of anything more relevant for our
                times
                than
                becoming a Waldorf teacher.”

                ~ Leslie Burchell-Fox, ’96; Early Childhood Teacher, Green Meadow Waldorf School, and Sunbridge Early

                The Origins of Waldorf Education
                In 1919, Emil Molt, owner of the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany, was looking to
                develop a
                school for the children of his employees. Molt was seeking a curriculum that would not only meet the
                children’s
                intellectual needs but speak also to their spiritual essence and humanity, thus helping them to flourish
                in
                the
                turbulent aftermath of the Great War. To develop this pedagogy, Molt turned to Rudolf Steiner. Steiner
                agreed to
                take on the task, under the conditions that the school be:

                Self-governed
                Artistically and culturally enriching
                Comprehensive (that is, not split into separate academic and vocational tracks)
                Open to all the workers’ children—girls and boys—from every walk of life
                Steiner insisted his school’s teachers perceive and respond to the developmental needs of the children.
                The
                intended
                outcome would be young people who were independent thinkers and problem-solvers, capable of creatively
                meeting the
                challenges of their time. This inclusive and forward-thinking spirit of idealism, commitment, and
                engagement
                with
                the world continues to be a hallmark of Waldorf education in our time.

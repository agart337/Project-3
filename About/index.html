                <div class="text">Waldorf education is a worldwide independent school movement developed in Europe
                    nearly 100 years ago by Austrian philosopher, social reformer, and visionary, Rudolf Steiner. In
                    Waldorf education, the learning process is essentially threefold, engaging head, heart, and
                    hands—or thinking, feeling, and doing.

                    through a curriculum and methodology that integrates academics, arts, and practical skills.

                <div div class="text">Waldorf schools work with the gradual development of students from childhood to
                    adulthood. This development follows a sequence of 3 seven-year phases, as soul, spirit and body
                    grow together. Each child’s development is a unique expression of the archetypal human journey, with
                    characteristic physical, emotional, and intellectual dimensions and growth patterns.</div>

                    The educational program is developed out of this understanding. Core components of the educational
                    program include the student-teacher relationship; the artistic approach; working from experience to
                    concept; working from whole to parts; use of rhythm and repetition; and observation as the
                    foundation for assessment.

                    Waldorf students cultivate their intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual capacities to
                    be individuals certain of their paths and to be of service to the world.

                    introduce children to the world through storytelling, music, and creative play. Our curriculum
                    includes activities that promote fine and gross motor skills, language development, social

                    We believe in providing a nurturing and supportive environment where children can freely explore
                    their surroundings. Our teachers serve as guides, offering gentle guidance and encouragement. Daily
                    rhythms and routines help children feel secure and develop a sense of trust in their environment.

                    Early childhood assessment takes a formative approach. We primarily rely on observation to
                    understand each child's unique progress. Teachers carefully observe and document children's
                    interactions, play, and social development. Parent-teacher conferences provide an opportunity for
                    dialogue and reflection.

                    mathematics, sciences, history, and world languages. Additionally, Waldorf education emphasizes
                    visual, performing and practical arts, and movement. The goal is to foster a deep love for learning
                    and a sense of curiosity in our students. In Grades 6-8 the curriculum expands and deepens. The goal
                    is to continue to deepen a love for learning while also increasing student confidence, skill
                    building, and proficiency.

                    students holistically. Teachers create lively lessons that appeal to different learning styles.
                    Hands-on activities, storytelling, and experiential learning are integral parts of the teaching
                    methodology. Students are guided through a comprehensive educational program that cultivates
                    intellectual, emotional, and social development.

                    Assessment in Grades 1-5 focuses on a comprehensive understanding of each student's progress.
                    Teachers observe and assess utilizing a combination of methods including written work, projects, and
                    oral presentations. Documenting student work helps track growth and development over time. Regular
                    assessments are supplemented with individual conferences and student self-assessment opportunities.
                    <br>
                    In Grades 6-8 students are evaluated based on their individual progress and growth. Teachers use a
                    variety of assessment tools such as observation and project-based assessment to gain an
                    understanding of each student’s strengths and areas for improvement.

                    self-reflection play a crucial role in assessing individual growth.

                    Children enjoy an unhurried childhood.
                    Visit a Waldorf school and watch the students at play. You’ll see children who delight in being
                    allowed to live in the moment, who are free to explore nature and to go where their wide-eyed sense
                    of wonder and imagination takes them. In our frenetic world, where pushing children to “hurry up or
                    fall behind” has become the norm, Waldorf education takes the point of view that childhood is
                    something to be savored. By being free to develop according to their own natural rhythms,
                    Waldorf-educated children enjoy full and rich childhoods, gaining the experiences they need to
                    become healthy, self-actualized individuals.

                    Learning is hands-on and age-appropriate.
                    You won’t find young children hovering around a computer in a Waldorf school classroom or missing a
                    walk in the woods or a trip to the farm in order to sit and cram for a standardized test. In Waldorf
                    education, learning is an experiential activity. It’s not a matter of doing without certain
                    experiences, it’s a matter of introducing children to each experience at the right time in their
                    development. When it’s time to teach the merits, uses, and hows of technology, Waldorf school
                    teachers do so. And the knowledge, self-awareness, and problem-solving skills children develop
                    through years of hands-on inquiry is of far greater value to them as learners and as human beings
                    than anything they could have picked up by sitting at a screen.

                    In-depth study enriches learning experiences.
                    The advantages of block learning have long been recognized in Waldorf education. In their daily
                    morning (or “main”) lesson, Waldorf students from first through twelfth grade spend up to two hours
                    concentrating on one subject which rotates every 3-4 weeks among the academic disciplines. Students
                    have the chance to study each subject thoroughly and from a number of vantage points, which
                    contributes to their enjoyment—and their understanding—of the subject matter.

                    Students learn how to take an active role in their own education.
                    From discovering the alphabet in the first grade to discovering anatomy, algebra, and U.S. history
                    in the eighth grade, and all the way up through their high school studies, Waldorf students take
                    part in the learning process by creating their own textbooks—beautifully-drawn journals containing
                    stories, essays, poems, maps, illustrations, lab descriptions, and math equations. Rather than
                    relying on pre-digested material presented to them in conventional textbooks, the act of creating
                    their “main lesson” books allows children to absorb the lessons their teachers bring them and to
                    make learning their own.

                    Waldorf schools produce well-rounded individuals.
                    Waldorf educators strive to bring out what lives in each student, but are careful not to
                    over-emphasize one trait or skill over another. All students study math and science and learn
                    foreign languages; they all play an instrument and sing in the chorus; they all learn handwork and
                    take movement classes and perform in the class play. The goal in Waldorf education is to expose
                    children to a wide range of experiences and to develop within them many interests and capabilities.
                    This, in turn, leads to well-balanced young people with high levels of confidence in their ability
                    to apply skills developed in one area to another, and the knowledge that they can master anything.

                    Waldorf-educated individuals have a lifelong passion for learning.
                    At a Waldorf school, education is not measured by competition and test scores, but is viewed as a
                    life-long journey. And an educational approach that appropriately responds to a child’s natural
                    interest in the world cannot help but result in an intrinsic desire to find out more.

                    Waldorf schools are sometimes erroneously seen as “art schools” because of the depth of the fine,
                    practical, and performing arts curriculum you’ll find here, woven in an interdisciplinary fashion
                    among all the subjects. Interestingly, however, it’s actually the sciences that become a career
                    choice for many Waldorf school alumni—an interest developed through years of exploration, invention,
                    and discovery.

                    Germany, was looking to develop a school for the children of his employees. Molt was seeking a
                    curriculum that would not only meet the children’s intellectual needs but speak also to their
                    spiritual essence and humanity, thus helping them to flourish in the turbulent aftermath of the
                    Great War.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <div class="text">
                    To develop this pedagogy, Molt turned to Rudolf Steiner. Steiner agreed to take on the
                    task, under the conditions that the school be:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <br>
                        <li>Self-governed</li>
                        <li>Artistically and culturally enriching</li>
                        <li>Comprehensive (that is, not split into separate academic and vocational tracks)</li>
                        <li>Open to all the workers’ children—girls and boys—from every walk of life</li>
                        <br>
                    </ol>
                    Steiner insisted his school’s teachers perceive and respond to the developmental needs of the
                    children. The intended outcome would be young people who were independent thinkers and
                    problem-solvers, capable of creatively meeting the challenges of their time. This inclusive and
                    forward-thinking spirit of idealism, commitment, and engagement with the world continues to be a
                    hallmark of Waldorf education in our time.

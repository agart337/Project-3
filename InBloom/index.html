                    Airport Road. Rooted in Rudolf Steiner’s educational philosophy, the school emphasizes nurturing
                    universal human values through meaningful learning experiences. The environment is designed to be
                    unhurried and secure, allowing children to explore and experience the richness of childhood.

                    At
                    InBloom, children engage in creative play and real-world activities like cooking, gardening, and
                    storytelling, fostering holistic development. The faculty comprises trained early childhood
                    educators who undergo regular training in child-centric Waldorf practices. InBloom is recognized by
                    the International Association of Steiner/Waldorf Early Childhood Education (IASWECE) and is a proud
                    member of the Sadhana Indian Waldorf Kindergarten Association (SWIKA).

                <div div class="text">
                    Founded in 2004, InBloom has been dedicated to helping children truly bloom through the Waldorf
                    approach. The school was established by Pooja Marshall, a trained Waldorf teacher with over two
                    decades of experience in early childhood education, and Ryan Marshall, a former professional jockey
                    with a deep understanding of nurturing environments.

                <div class="text">
                    Their combined expertise has shaped InBloom
                    into a space where children can develop physically, emotionally, and cognitively. Over the years,
                    InBloom has expanded its programs to include parent-toddler groups, kindergarten, after-school care,
                    and a homeschool program, all tailored to the needs of young learners. The school's commitment to
                    the Waldorf philosophy has made it a cornerstone in the Indian Waldorf education movement.

                <div div class="text">
                    InBloom's curriculum is experiential and multi-sensory, designed to align with the natural rhythms
                    of the day, seasons, and festivals. Rather than teaching numbers, language, and science in
                    isolation, these subjects are interwoven into daily activities like circle time, storytelling,
                    cooking, and nature walks.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Children develop numeracy through rhymes and domestic tasks, language
                    through rich vocabulary in songs and stories, and scientific understanding through gardening and
                    observing seasonal changes. The curriculum emphasizes the development of life skills, values, and
                    habits that last a lifetime, fostering a lifelong love for learning. ​

                <div div class="text">
                    To experience the InBloom way, prospective parents are invited to schedule a school visit by calling
                    +91 98454 91707 or requesting one through <a href="https://www.inbloom.in/admissions"
                        class="form"><b>this portal</b></a>. During the visit, families can tour the school, meet the
                    faculty, and learn about
                    the
                    customized curriculum tailored to each child's needs.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Following the visit, parents can submit an
                    application and pay the fees to enroll their child. A home visit is then scheduled, allowing InBloom
                    teachers to understand the child's home environment better. Finally, parents are invited to observe
                    a class, gaining deeper insight into the school's approach to early childhood education. ​

                            A typical day at InBloom provides a peaceful and predictable environment where children feel
                            safe to explore. Activities include creative play, cooking, painting, crafts, gardening,
                            singing, storytelling, and daily nature walks. The day follows a reassuring pattern,
                            balancing child-led and teacher-led activities.

                            These subjects are integrated into daily activities. Numeracy is developed through rhymes
                            and domestic tasks; language through songs and stories; science through gardening and

                            Teachers mindfully observe each child's development, collaborating with parents to build on
                            their progress both at school and home. Aside from this, children engage in meaningful real
                            work like painting, cooking, gardening, and crafts, developing motor skills, social skills,
                            and a sense of self.​

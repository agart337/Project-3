                <div class="text">
                    Aarambh Waldorf School, situated in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, offers education from Kindergarten
                    through Grade 5. Rooted in the Waldorf philosophy developed by Rudolf Steiner, the school emphasizes
                    holistic development—nurturing the head (intellect), heart (emotions), and hands (practical skills).

                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Aarambh's approach
                    integrates academic learning with physical activity, arts, and moral responsibility, fostering a
                    balanced growth of body, mind, and spirit. The school also emphasizes a strong connection to nature
                    and the local culture, integrating seasonal festivals and environmental stewardship into the
                    learning experience.

                <div div class="text">
                    Established in 2013, Aarambh began as a small kindergarten with just four children. Over time, it
                    expanded to include primary grades up to Grade 5, reflecting a growing interest in alternative
                    education in Delhi. In its early years, the school moved to a more spacious campus at Shanti Kunj
                    Farms to accommodate its expanding community.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The journey has been marked by active parent
                    participation, from setting up classrooms to organizing events that promote the Waldorf philosophy.
                    Workshops and orientations have been integral in building awareness about the school's unique
                    approach to education.

                <div class="subheading Delhi">Curriculum</div>
                <div div class="text">
                    Aarambh's curriculum is age-appropriate and focuses on the physical, emotional, and intellectual
                    development of children. In the early years, learning is centered around imitation and play, with
                    activities like unstructured play, arts, gardening, and cooking to develop foundational senses and
                    motor skills.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    As children progress to primary grades, the curriculum integrates academic subjects
                    with arts, music, and movement, fostering a love for learning.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The school does not employ
                    traditional grading systems; instead, teachers maintain detailed narrative reports that provide a
                    comprehensive view of each child's progress. This approach ensures that education is tailored to
                    meet the individual needs of each student.

                            <br>
                            Kindergarten groups typically consist of 15-20 children with two teachers and additional
                            staff. Primary grade classes are smaller, ranging from 4-8 students.

                            <br>
                            The kindergarten curriculum focuses on unstructured play, arts, gardening, and other
                            hands-on activities that build foundational skills and prepare children for academic
                            learning.

                        <li><b>How do children transition to formal academics later on?</b>
                            <br>
                            The foundation built through early activities ensures that children develop the necessary
                            skills for academic learning, such as focus, motor skills, and the ability to sit for longer
                            durations.

                            <br>
                            Reading and writing are introduced after the age of six, aligning with the child's
                            developmental readiness.

                    Aikya was founded with the vision of creating a nurturing community where simplicity and human

                    journey began with a commitment to holistic education, integrating academic pursuits with emotional
                    and physical development.

                    Ferdinand Udaykumar and Swapna, brought diverse backgrounds and a shared passion for education to

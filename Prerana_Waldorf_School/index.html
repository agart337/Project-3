                <div div class="text">
                    Established in 2001 by Indira and Maj Varma, Prerana Waldorf School began as a kindergarten and
                    nursery, gradually expanding by adding one grade each year. The founders were inspired by the need
                    for an education system that nurtures the sanctity of childhood, leading them to adopt the Waldorf
                    educational philosophy developed by Rudolf Steiner.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    This approach emphasizes holistic development
                    and social responsibility. Initially located in Banjara Hills, the school later moved to its own
                    campus in Gachibowli, evolving into a dynamic community serving students up to Grade XII. Prerana
                    meets all CBSE board requirements while incorporating Waldorf methodologies up to Grade VIII.

                        <li><b>How is Waldorf education different from other educational systems?</b>

                            <br>
                            Waldorf education is child-centered, meeting children at their developmental stage and
                            nurturing their intellectual, emotional, and practical capacities. It emphasizes holistic
                            development over early academic pressure. ​

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Is Waldorf similar to Montessori?</b>

                            <br>
                            While both emphasize developmentally appropriate, hands-on learning, Montessori focuses on
                            early academics and individual achievement, whereas Waldorf prioritizes imagination and
                            social collaboration.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Is Waldorf education religious?</b>

                            <br>

                            Waldorf schools are non-sectarian and non-denominational. They honor the spiritual dimension
                            of life without adhering to any specific religious doctrine, celebrating festivals from
                            various traditions. ​

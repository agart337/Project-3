                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Why choose a Waldorf school for my child?</b>

                            <br>
                            Waldorf schools prioritize the holistic development of children, focusing on intellectual,
                            emotional, and creative growth. They provide nurturing environments that respect the wonder
                            of childhood, integrating play, nature, and hands-on learning into the curriculum.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Why is formal reading introduced later in Waldorf schools?</b>

                            <br>
                            Formal reading is typically introduced in Grade 1 to align with children's developmental
                            readiness. This approach allows children to fully engage in imaginative play and
                            experiential learning during their early years, laying a strong foundation for future
                            academic skills.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Why do Waldorf schools discourage TV watching and electronic media?</b>

                            <br>
                            Electronic
                            media are believed by Waldorf teachers to seriously hamper the development of the child’s
                            imagination – a faculty which is believed to be central to the healthy development of the
                            individual. Computer use by young children is also discouraged.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>How does grading work</b>

                            <br>
                            A full assessment of each student’s progress is provided in the form of a year-end narrative
                            assessment in all subject areas. These assessments are supported by teacher conferences and
                            class meetings throughout the year.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Does Waldorf education suit all children?</b>

                            <br>
                            Our education suits a wide range of children and is helpful to children who enjoy insightful
                            teachers and a warm and friendly environment. The confidence and support of parents who have
                            a good understanding of the schools ’aims is very helpful to their children.

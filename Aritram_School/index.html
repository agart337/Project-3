                <div div class="text">
                    Aritram School was established by a community of families seeking a holistic and artistic approach
                    to education for their children. Inspired by the Waldorf philosophy, which originated from the work
                    of Rudolf Steiner in 1919, the school aims to provide an education that addresses the needs of the
                    whole child.

                <div class="text">
                    Since its inception, Aritram has grown into a nurturing space that emphasizes
                    experiential learning and the integration of arts across the curriculum. The school's development
                    reflects a commitment to creating an environment where children can thrive intellectually,
                    emotionally, and socially.

                <div div class="text">
                    Aritram's curriculum is designed to align with the developmental stages of children, offering
                    programs from Kindergarten (ages 2.5–6) through Grade 6. In Kindergarten, children engage in
                    activities like free play, cooking, crafting, and gardening, fostering learning through imitation
                    and daily rhythms.

                <div class="text">
                    From Grade 1 onwards, the curriculum includes language arts, mathematics,
                    science, form drawing, foreign languages, handwork, and sports, all taught creatively through
                    stories, poetry, and movement. The curriculum emphasizes experiential learning, integrating arts
                    into all subjects to cultivate clear thinking and a lifelong love of learning.

                <div div class="text">
                    Aritram School's admission process begins with an Orientation/School Visit, where prospective
                    parents can learn about the Waldorf education approach and the school's environment. Following the
                    orientation, parents interested in enrolling their child can submit an admission form. The next step
                    involves a Child Observation period, lasting 1 to 5 days, to assess the child's readiness and
                    compatibility with the school's approach. After the observation, the school communicates the outcome
                    within 48 hours. Upon acceptance, an Induction session is conducted to guide parents through the
                    school's practices and help them integrate into the Aritram community.

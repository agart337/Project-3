                    values, and attitudes. Tatva aims to nurture each child's potential, preparing them to thrive amidst

                <div div class="text">
                    Founded in 2009 by S. Balasubramanian and R. Vidyalakshmi, both alumni of IIM Ahmedabad, Tatva
                    School began as a preschool in Velachery. Recognizing the need for a transformative approach to
                    education, they established Tatva to prioritize the child's developmental journey.

                    Over the years,
                    the school expanded, now operating campuses in Velachery and Medavakkam, with plans to upgrade to a
                    full-fledged K-12 institution. Tatva's mission is to lead a positive transformation in education,
                    making learning a joyful and purposeful experience.

                    Indradhanu's Early Childhood Programme, encompassing Nursery (24 months to 3½ years) and
                    Kindergarten (3½ to 6 years), is designed as a home away from home. Recognizing that these formative
                    years are crucial, the school emphasizes learning through imitation and repetition, seamlessly
                    integrating education into meaningful work within a nurturing environment.

                    In the Grade School, each day begins with a two-hour Main Lesson focusing on a single subject for
                    four weeks, utilizing movement, art, music, and storytelling. Subjects are taught through hands-on
                    experiences, ensuring that education engages all senses and fosters a deep connection to the
                    material.

                    curriculum, preparing students for the IGCSE examinations in Grade 10. Despite this shift, the
                    school continues to employ Waldorf principles, ensuring a stress-free environment that encourages
                    experimentation, real-world application through camps and outdoor trips, and the cultivation of
                    healthy social relationships and self-awareness.

                    Founded in 2007, Kingdom of Childhood is one of the oldest Waldorf-Steiner schools in Bangalore. The
                    school was established by Mr. Manivannan, an educator with over 30 years of experience, who
                    initiated the institution based on his personal experience of homeschooling his children during a
                    time when the concept was not widely recognized in India.

                    His vision was to create an educational
                    environment rooted in Steiner's philosophy, focusing on holistic development and inclusivity. Over
                    the years, KOC has grown into a vibrant community that continues to uphold these foundational
                    principles.

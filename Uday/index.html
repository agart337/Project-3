                    Uday, meaning "sunrise," is Jaipur's first and only school inspired by the Waldorf philosophy.
                    Established in November 2014, it began as a Kindergarten with just four children. Founded by
                    Gurpreet, a mother seeking holistic education for her child, Uday emphasizes experiential learning
                    and the development of critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and artistic expression. The
                    school aims to nurture self-motivated and responsible individuals, preparing them to make positive
                    contributions to society.

                <div div class="text">
                    Uday's inception was driven by Gurpreet's quest for meaningful education aligning with her values.
                    Discovering the Waldorf philosophy, which emphasizes holistic child development, she transitioned
                    from her corporate career to establish Uday in 2014. Starting with a small Kindergarten, the school
                    has grown steadily, now offering classes up to Grade 5, with plans to expand to Grade 12. Uday
                    remains committed to quality education, ensuring each child's growth is nurtured without
                    compromising its core ethos.

                    Uday's curriculum is rooted in Waldorf education principles, focusing on holistic
                    development—intellectual, emotional, and physical. It integrates arts and academics, promoting
                    age-appropriate, joyous, and self-directed learning. The approach emphasizes imagination over rote
                    learning, fostering creativity and resilience. By catering to the developmental stages of children,
                    Uday aims to instill a lifelong love for learning and prepare students to face future challenges
                    with confidence.

                    forms. Subsequent meetings with parents and the child are scheduled to ensure alignment with the
                    school's philosophy. Uday emphasizes a collaborative partnership with families, encouraging
                    active
                    parental involvement in the child's educational journey.

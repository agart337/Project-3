                            <br>
                            Developed by Rudolf Steiner in 1919, Waldorf Education is based on a developmental approach
                            that addresses the needs of the growing child and maturing adolescent. It aims to educate
                            the whole child—the heart and the hands, as well as the head.

                            <br>
                            The curriculum is designed to meet various stages of child development, fostering enthusiasm
                            for learning. Preschool and Kindergarten focus on imitation and imagination, while
                            elementary and middle school include subjects like literature, history, sciences,
                            mathematics, foreign languages, arts, and physical education.
